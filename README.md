### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nick, and I'm a MBA that writes code. Currently building web and mobile applications @sudokrew and @agathon.

I am a full-stack developer, and lately my work has been leaning into the front-end application layer. I write lots of javascript, typescript, node.js, and php.
