### Hi there 👋

My name is Nick, and I'm a software engineer :nerd_face: with an MBA degree :mortar_board:. Currently building games [@conceptarthouse](https://www.conceptarthouse.com/) and teaching full-stack development [@trilogyed](https://www.trilogyed.com/)

I am interested in crypto, gaming, and cloud infrastructure (not necessarily in that order). I write lots of JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.

Feel free to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-gambino/), I love talking about the future! :rocket:
